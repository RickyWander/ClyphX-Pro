- Copy all .txts to preferences in nativeKontrol folder
- Set your 8 knobs on channel 11 assign them to "control change" 1 to 8 
- Set your buttons on channel 11 assign them to notes from 1 to 24
- In Ableton preferences select your controller for Input and output on ClyphX Control surface (see image)


And then open the Ableton project "Fx Buss 1-9-1" and put your clips on track 16 or add your new tracks after track 16 and assign a send out to track 16 in so you can use the send to feed FXBus.

                                                      Presentation 
                                                      
FX-BUS is a multi-effect "to play" that resides within any project Ableton and is proposed as addon of the two "stations" Live386 and DreamMachine.
Some essential logic functions (the fateful ClyphX Actions by Stray) are exposed in the Ableton project both in order to allow the user to edit and transform behaviors at will, and to give him an idea of how ClyphX works and maybe start writing his own custom actions.
In addition, with a wifi network and a mobile device we will have a display dedicated to the controls in use at the time thanks to the dynamic mapping of Bindings using Touch-OSC app.
FXBUS is equipped with 8 Rack effects (Device) and is controlled with 8 knobs (two groups of 4 knobs) and 16 buttons.

SMART (from Isotonik Collective, not strictly necessary), the eighth rack in the chain, is a special macro control device that allows you to put on one of its 8 knobs the 8 knobs of each of the first 7 Racks in the chain. 

Features
1. 8 effect units (SMART not strictly required). You can cut some of them and put here your own device.
2. Dynamic BIND Mapping and Button Modes
3. Recalling presets and time ramps
4. Saving presets for individual devices
5. Global A/B/C/D/E/F Preset Save/Recall Morphing
6. 8 Macro "1X8" controls on individual devices
7. Hyper control "1X64"
8. Parameter randomization
9. Display of controls on Android (Touch OSC + Bindings required)
10. Dynamic Mapping SysEx on Behringer X-Touch Mini
11. Simplified customization
12. Using a Second Grid Controller


                                    The user manuals needs to be updated/finished
                                    For any question refer to either
