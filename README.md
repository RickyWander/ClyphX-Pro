# ClyphX-Pro
FXBUS 1.0 Multiple FX Morpher
Presentation
FX-BUS is a multi-effect "to play" that resides within any project Ableton and is proposed as addon of the two "stations" Live386 and DreamMachine.
Some essential logic functions (the fateful ClyphX Actions by Stray) are exposed in the Ableton project both in order to allow the user to edit and transform behaviors at will, and to give him an idea of how ClyphX works and maybe start writing his own custom actions.
In addition, with a wifi network and a mobile device we will have a display dedicated to the controls in use at the time thanks to the dynamic mapping of Bindings.
FXBUS is equipped with 8 Rack effects (Device) and is controlled with 8 knobs (two groups of 4 knobs) and 16 buttons.

SMART, the eighth rack in the chain, is a special macro control device that allows you to put on one of its 8 knobs the 8 knobs of each of the first 7 Racks in the chain. Its first 7 "1x8" poins move by themselves the eight knobs of each of the previous 7 Racks.
